I had a hard time deciding where to start with the CLI Project. At first i couldnt find a site to scrape that wasnt too complex. and was pretty straight forward. I tried several movie sites with the hopes of scraping box office hits and providing the user with time for a selected movie, but i realized there was a few things that were not optimal with the sites that I chose.

For a few of the sites the code was dificult to pull elements from with nokogiri. I tried multiple sites before I ultimatley setled on the site I chose for the project. I chose Microcenter because the site layout was simple and the class and id tags were easy to read. The movie sites had class tags like "*.hgiygdq77qhiuqg09983oiuhqdq*", while Microcenter had simple tags like "*productDetails*". 

Once I decided on the site the rest of the lab was a bit easier and started flowing.
