## Finding a Site to Scrape

I had a hard time deciding where to start with the CLI Project. At first i couldnt find a site to scrape that wasnt too complex. and was pretty straight forward. I tried several movie sites with the hopes of scraping box office hits and providing the user with time for a selected movie, but i realized there was a few things that were not optimal with the sites that I chose.

For a few of the sites the code was dificult to pull elements from with nokogiri. I tried multiple sites before I ultimatley setled on the site I chose for the project. I chose Microcenter because the site layout was simple and the class and id tags were easy to read. The movie sites had class tags like "*.hgiygdq77qhiuqg09983oiuhqdq*", while Microcenter had simple tags like "*productDetails*".  Once I decided on the site the rest of the lab was a bit easier and started flowing. 

## Dealing with Procrastination

I had an issue, after starting the project, with time management. With thinkg getting alittle more hectic and demanding at work, I barely found the time to log in to Learn and actually do the project, Earlier in the month of may  I had already finished a bulk. of the project. The only taks needed to be done were the README.md and recording the walk through. It seemed like a chore to get through after working longer than usual shifts at work.  It was then that I decided I would take a short brake from the projct and return to it once things hae slowed down at work.

Before I knew it,  a month had passed by and I hadnt done any additional work on the project. At this point I felt Like I was just wasting my money. And I was never going to finish in time. I was wondering when things would quiet down enough in my day to day that I will have some time to dedicate to actually completing this program.

I now have a little more free time than usual so I plan to take full advantage and finish the project and complete as much more of the program as I can.
